Summary
This project combines a frontend code editor with a backend API to allow users to write, compile, and run code in multiple languages directly from their browser. The frontend uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive editor, while the backend leverages Node.js and Express.js to handle code compilation and execution.

Project Overview
You’re working on a web-based code editor that allows users to write and execute code in multiple programming languages (C++, Java, and Python). Here’s a breakdown of the components:

HTML File:

Purpose: Sets up the structure and layout of the code editor interface.
Key Features:
Code Editor: Uses CodeMirror to provide a rich code-editing experience with syntax highlighting.
Language Selection: Allows users to choose the programming language (C++, Java, Python) via a dropdown menu.
Input and Output Sections: Provides text areas for users to input code and see the output.
Buttons: Includes a run button to execute the code.
Dependencies: Integrates Bootstrap for styling and uses CodeMirror for code editing.
CSS:

Purpose: Styles the editor layout and elements.
Key Features:
Responsive Layout: Uses Bootstrap classes to ensure a responsive design.
Editor Styling: Customizes the appearance of the code editor using CodeMirror’s Dracula theme.
JavaScript:

Purpose: Implements the functionality of the code editor and handles interactions.
Key Features:
Editor Initialization: Sets up CodeMirror with syntax highlighting and auto-closing brackets.
Language Switching: Updates the editor’s syntax highlighting mode based on user selection.
Code Execution: Sends code to a server for compilation and displays the output.
API (Node.js with Express.js):

Purpose: Provides the backend functionality for compiling and running code.
Key Features:
Routes:
GET /: Serves the HTML file for the code editor.
POST /compile: Accepts code and execution details, compiles the code using the compilex library, and returns the output.
Dependencies:
body-parser: Parses incoming request bodies.
compilex: Compiles and runs C++, Java, and Python code.
express: Manages HTTP requests and serves static files.
JSON Package (package.json):

Purpose: Manages project dependencies and scripts.
Key Features:
Dependencies:
body-parser, compilex, express, and nodemon are included for handling server functionality and development.
Scripts: Includes a test script placeholder.

Custom API
The custom API you’ve developed uses Node.js and Express.js to facilitate the execution of code written in multiple programming languages. It integrates the compilex library to compile and run C++, Java, and Python code. The API exposes two main routes: GET / serves the static HTML file for the code editor, while POST /compile processes code submissions. The POST /compile route handles requests by receiving the code, input data, and selected language, then delegates the compilation and execution tasks to the compilex library. It returns the output or any errors encountered during execution to the frontend, enabling users to interactively test their code. This custom API effectively bridges the frontend editor with backend processing, providing a seamless experience for running and testing code.
